Data labels

pH = experimental growth rates replicated from these pHs (7.9 = representative of ambient conditions)

pop_dens = # of colonies in simulation

settle_time = settlement time of later settling cohort (days)

COD = cost of defense (mm2)

mean_cont = mean undefended colony size (mm2)

mean_pred = mean defended colony size (mm2)

mean_total = mean colony size (mm2)

mean_cont_late = mean undefended colony size (from colonies settling in the late cohort) (mm2)

mean_pred_late = mean defended colony size (from colonies settling in the late cohort) (mm2)

mean_total_late = mean colony size (from colonies settling in the late cohort) (mm2)
